Size Limitations <---- Currently supports up to 5GB of video

Tested locally and the overall extraction process is quick.

Created using the following:

IDE      <---- VSCode
Frontend <---- HTML, CSS
Backend  <---- Flask, Python, Javascript
Hosting  <---- Hosted locally for now.. Thinking of Heroku, Amazon, Github.. Not quite sure yet?

I've had no issue running this locally and having free access to audio extraction from provided video.
